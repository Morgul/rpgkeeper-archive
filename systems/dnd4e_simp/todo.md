# ToDo:

## General
* ~~Fix the character detail fields so they don't auto-size, but instead have a fixed size, and just float together properly~~
* ~~Add missing fields from the character details into the character model~~
* Move the calculation logic from the server to the client
* ~~Add support for adding/removing conditions~~
* ~~Add support for character profile~~
* ~~Add support for displaying choices?~~
* ~~Hook up the passive skills~~
* Make Character Details collapsible (and start collapsed on small screens.)
* Add character name to nav bar

# Classes
* Need to have the ability to add classes, which will store some basic information, like HP/level and healing surges.

# HPCalc
* Need to make HPCalc actually function like the previous one.

## Skills
* ~~Add support for editing skills~~
* ~~Add support for adding skills~~

## Powers
* Figure out how to support custom powers
* Add support for adding and displaying powers
* Add support for marking powers as used
* Add support for editing powers

## Feats
* Build support for feats, similar to powers.
* Feats need to have associated bonuses that can be used in calculating stats.

# Combat Statistics
* Need support for editing the misc bonuses used for calculating those values.
* Eventually, need a rolls style interface.

...and more to come!
