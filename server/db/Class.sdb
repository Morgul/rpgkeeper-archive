You could be a platinum-garbed envoy of Bahamut seeking justice throughout the land, a shadowy follower of Sehanine with a roguish streak, a burly disciple of Kord who believes the virtue of strength is sufficient for all challenges, or a dwarf cleric of Moradin bringing honor to the denizens of your mountain home.\r\n\r\nWill you protect what is sacred to your god, quest for legendary holy artifacts, pursue a life of evangelical adventuring, or attempt all these deeds and more?","initialHP":12,"hpPerLevel":5,"$id":"6nSSXMnVzeS8hy7u"},"Battlemind":{"name":"Battlemind","description":"As wanderers. mercenaries. and adventurers. battle­ minds are carefree warriors who seek only to test their skill against the mightiest and most dangerous opponents.

They charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy’s strike.

These rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals.\r\nAs a barbarian, you have a link to powerful nature spirits and other primal forces bound to the warriors\r\nof your tribe by the songs and totems of your legacy. These spirits lend energy to your rages, transforming you into a devastating force on the battlefield. As you become more experienced, these rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power or gifting you with supernatural recuperative powers.\r\nWhen the heat of battle is upon you, will you respond with a sudden charge that fells with one mighty swing of your weapon, or with a prolonged rage that leaves destroyed foes in your wake?","initialHP":15,"hpPerLevel":6,"$id":"OM6DGGB7Z3QIuSZ0"},"Druid":{"name":"Druid","description":"Secretive and enigmatic, druids call the wilderness their home.

If wizards wield magic as fighters wield swords, a sorcerer’s magic is the arcing greataxe of a raging barbarian.\r\n\r\nYou might be a proud dragonborn scion of ancient Arkhosia, calling on the draconic power of your heritage, or perhaps you were bathed in dragon blood as an infant to fill you with that power.

A bard’s artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world’s rulers.\r\nArt and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet.
